## 👨‍🎓 About Me  

I am **Qi You**, a *Ph.D. candidate* at the **College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Xiamen University**, under the supervision of [Prof. Jun Cheng](#) and [Prof. Fujie Tang](#). My research focuses on **computational spectroscopy** for complex electrochemical systems, particularly on *dynamic Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectra in electrolytes*. By integrating **first-principles** and **machine learning methods**, we aim to explore the intrinsic correlations between *molecular structures* and *spectral features*.
