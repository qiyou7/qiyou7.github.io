# Decoding the Competing Effects of Dynamic Solvation Structures on Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Chemical Shifts of Battery Electrolytes via Machine Learning

I’m pleased to share that my first-year PhD project on computational NMR spectra for electrolytes has been published in *J. Am. Chem. Soc.*. 

In this work, we developed a machine learning approach combining MLPs and NN-NMR to predict ⁷Li NMR spectra in LiFSI/DME electrolytes. An anomalous reversal in the chemical shift trend with increasing concentration was identified and attributed to two competing local solvation structures.

I would like to express my gratitude to **Prof. Cheng** and **Prof. Tang** for their invaluable guidance throughout this work.
