I'm pleased to share that my first-year PhD project on computational NMR spectra for electrolytes has been published in *J. Am. Chem. Soc.*. In this work, we developed a machine learning approach combining MLPs and NN-NMR to predict $^7$Li NMR spectra in LiFSI/DME electrolytes. An anomalous reversal in the chemical shift trend with increasing concentration was identified and attributed to two competing local solvation structures.

I would like to thank Prof. Cheng and Prof. Tang for their guidance throughout this work.
